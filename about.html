          <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
          <p>The mission of S&E Security Ltd is to prevent crime against commercial enterprise, to help our clients keep their businesses secure, to protect multi numbers of companies on commercial Trading & Industrial Estates against the ravages of crime and vandalism.</p>
          <p>The effect of our work is to provide peace of mind to Company Directors and Managers, cut out the losses caused by crime and vandalism and the financial and psychological aftermath. </p>
          <p>The secondary effect of our mission is that we are able to provide on site security, on or close to the industrial areas we protect, with immediate attention to labour problems that larger companies are unable to match.</p>
          <p>This whole ethos of our work is environmentally beneficial to all companies within the estates we protect. </p>

          <h5>Environmental Policy</h5>
          <p>At S&E Security Ltd We like to think that we are an environmentally friendly company.</p>
          <p>As a manned guarding company we do not manufacture anything nor do we use anything that is environmentally undesirable, other than vehicle fuel. We have looked into the possibility of using electric/gas fuelled vehicles and have concluded that this is not a viable option at this stage.</p>
          <p>However, our work in industrial estate protection is an advantage to the environment in that valuable resources are not wasted or used up in repairing and replacing damaged building or stolen equipment.</p>
          <p>A lot of the estates we protect show an increased pride in their surroundings as the occupants see that vandalism is virtually non-existent and it is worth caring for their buildings, fences and surroundings.</p>
          <p>Wherever possible we will recycle all paper we are mindful of electricity wastage and ensure that power supplies and lighting are not used unnecessarily or left on when or premises are empty.</p>
